#### **Instructions**

Preparation

- Dice up your ginger, garlic, and chili peppers.
- Gather spices:
  - 1/2 teaspoon coriander
  - 1/2 teaspoon Indian red chili powder
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 1 teaspoon garam masala
  - 2 teaspoons curry powder

- Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.

Cooking

- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, fresh turmeric and Serrano pepper and cook for 2 minutes,  stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning.
- Add the spices + salt and pepper and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently.
- Pour in the vegetable broth, and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot.
- Add in the lentils and the crushed tomatoes and mix well.
- Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and have mostly softened. 
- Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5 to 8 minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy. 
- Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat.

Serving

- Serve the curry with rice and/or Indian flatbread and garnish with additional cilantro.
